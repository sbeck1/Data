#Note from Caleb
#I have attached a file that shows the structure of our water quality data.  
#I also attached our physical data, since you will need to merge the two together by Reference.  
#The physical data will provide location (GPS and Zone B), date, and time.

# read in water quality data (hydro) and physical data (physical)
hydro = read.sas7bdat("Cooperator_WQ/ckm_hydrolab.sas7bdat")

# write to csv
